## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

The COVID-19 pandemic is a current global pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. As of October 21st 2020 there have been more than 1.12 million deaths, and more than 40.5 million confirmed cases [1]. As a Microbiology student, I have been studying COVID-19 in my courses with an emphasis on immunology, pathophysiology, genomics and diagnostics but by working on this project I hope to gain a deeper understanding and working knowledge about how data analytics and manipulation are used in healthcare and epidemiology. I want to understand and visualize how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected mortality for different ethnic groups in all 50 US states. People of color are disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic due to many reasons such as: socioeconomic status, housing, healthcare access, and occupational hazards [2]. Visualizing and analyzing this data can highlight the struggles that these marginalized communities are facing, and hopefully help them reach health equity. 

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

This dataset was posted to data.world by Liz Friedman, and is updated daily via the COVID Racial Data Tracker. The COVID Racial Data Tracker is a collaboration between the COVID Tracking Project and the Antiracist Research & Policy Center [3]. The project was created when Dr. Ibram X. Kendi brought attention to the urgent need to gather data from different ethnic groups to understand how the outbreak is affecting communitites and how to protect the most vulnerable. This dataset contains 28 columns with 2,999 rows and includes the number of cases and number of deaths by ethnicity for each US state. The ethnic groups in this dataset include: white, black, latinx, asian, AIAN (American Indian and Alaska Native), NHPI (Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander), multiracial, other and unknown. The first data entry was on April 15th 2020, almost a month after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak as a 'pandemic' [4]. This dataset was created to educate the public about how COVID-19 affects mortality in different ethnic groups.
