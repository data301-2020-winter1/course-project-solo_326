## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

The COVID-19 pandemic is a current global pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. As of October 21st 2020 there have been more than 1.12 million deaths, and more than 40.5 million confirmed cases [1]. As a Microbiology student, I have been studying COVID-19 in my courses with an emphasis on immunology, pathophysiology, genomics and diagnostics but   People of color are disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic due to many reasons such as: socioeconomic status, housing, healthcare access, and occupational hazards [2]. Visualizing and analyzing this data can highlight the struggles that these marginialized communities are facing in a pandemic. 

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

This dataset was posted to data.world by Liz Friedman and is constantly updated. It contains 28 columns with 2,999 rows and includes the number of cases and number of deaths by ethnicity for each US state. The first data entry was on April 15th 2020, almost a month after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak as a 'pandemic' [3]. This dataset was created to educate the public about the AIAN stands for 'American Indian and Alaska Native', and NHPI stands for 'Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander'.
